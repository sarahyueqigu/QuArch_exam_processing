## Question 1 (34%)

You have recently been recruited by InDec Corp. to work on a second version of their
"Alphium" processor. Alphium is a simple inorder processor with 5 pipeline stages. Its clock
frequency is 600MHz and the chip power supply (Vcc) is 1.65V. Alphium achieves an IPC

1
of 0.8 instructions per cycle on a specific benchmark. ( IPC = ).
CPI

Your assignment is to evaluate the improvement in execution time, power and energy
consumption for four proposed new versions of the Alphium processor. Here is a description
of the alternatives:

  - Low Power Alphium (LPA): This would be the same design as the original
Alphium but it would be clocked at 400MHz to save power. The power supply (Vcc)
would remain 1.65V and the achieved IPC would be 0.8 again.

  - Superscalar Alphium (SSA): This would be a 4-way superscalar version of the
Alphium. It would have the ability to issue up to 4 instruction per cycle. The power
supply (Vcc) would remain 1.65V but the clock frequency would be reduced to
500MHz, due to the complexity of the issuing logic. The achieved IPC would be 2.
Assume that the effective capacitance switched in the superscalar design would be 4
times that of the original.

  - Low Voltage Alphium (LVA): This would be the same design as the original
Alphium again but both the power supply and the clock frequency would be reduced.
Power supply (Vcc) would be 1V and clock frequency would be 400MHz. The IPC
would remain 0.8.

  - Low Voltage Superscalar Alphium (LVSSA): This would be a 4-way superscalar
version of with reduced power supply. The clock frequency would be 300MHZ, the
power supply (Vcc) would be 1V and an IPC of 2 would be achieved. Assume that
the effective capacitance switched in the superscalar design would be 4 times that of
the original.

Here is some information that you may find useful:

Power: When we measure power for a system, we care about the maximum instantaneous
power the system can consume. This is important as it determines the maximum current that
the power supply must be able to supply to the system and the amount of heat that has to be
removed from the system. In this question, the system refers to the processor only.

Energy: E=C*Vcc[2] is just the energy per transaction. This is not interesting. We care about
the energy consumed from the power supply to execute a task (or perform some
computation). Once the task is executed, the processor can be turned off and no further
energy is needed. The energy per task determines how many tasks you can execute before
the battery runs out.

## Question 1 (cont)

A) [10 points] Complete the basic formulas that will allow you to compare the 5
alternatives to the original Alphium. You will need the formulas for execution time, power
consumption, energy consumption for the benchmark, performance per power ratio for the
benchmark and performance per energy ratio for the benchmark. (Hint: for your
convenience, assume a given task has a predefined number of instructions - e.g., 10[6] )

## Question 1 (cont)

B) [10 points] Fill in the two following tables. In each box write how the proposed new


version compares to the original Alphium for that feature (e.g.

Two fractional digits per entry are enough.

performance/power, performance/energy) would you use to pick a processor? Why?

## Question 2 (36%)

Branch Prediction

A) [8 points]
1. What is the minimal history length (in number of bits) required in a local predictor
for a perfect prediction (once the predictor warms up) of each one of the following
recurrent infinite sequences:

010101 ...      ___

00110011 ...    ___

001001 ...      ___

2. Find a pattern with a maximal length, which may be perfectly predicted by a local
predictor with a history length of 3 bits (once the predictor warms up). Explain.
(hint: you do not have to show the sequence!)

B) [20 points] The following three predictors are given:

1. A Bimodal Predictor (BP), made of an array of 2-bit saturating counters, initialized
to weakly taken (2).

2. A Local Predictor (LP) with a history of length 3, were histories are initialized to
000, and each history points to an array of counter similar to that of predictor (BP).

3. A Chooser (Ch) which uses an array of counters similar to that of (BP) to choose
between predictor (BP) and predictor (LP). The chooser counters are initialized to
weakly point at predictor (BP). And it uses the following state machine:


-----

## Question 2 (Cont)

LP correct LP correct LP correct

SBP WBP WLP SLP

BP correct & BP correct & BP correct &
LP wrong LP wrong LP wrong

When both predictors are wrong the state doesnâ€™t change.

SBP = Strongly BP, takes Bimodal Prediction
WBP= Weakly BP, takes Bimodal Prediction

SLP = Strongly LP, Takes Local Prediction
WLP= Weakly BP, Takes Local Prediction

The sequence in the chooser table below belongs to a single branch.
You have to fill this table, for the BP and LP rows mark T if the predictor is correct and
F if it is wrong.
For the Ch row mark SBP, WPB, WLP or SLP according to the chooser next state.
For the OP row mark the current overall prediction (1/0).
Use the Bimodal Predictor Log and Local Predictor Log tables to help you in the BP and
LP predictions:

## Question 2 (Cont)

C) [8 points] Some local predictors include 2 types of history - real history, and speculative
history. The real history register tracks the branch behavior at retirement time of the branch.
The speculative history register tracks the branch behavior at fetch time of the branch, based
on the BTB prediction. On misprediction, in addition to flushing the pipe, the real history of
every branch is copied to the speculative history. The following questions relate to the 2
types of history.

1. Which type of history would you use for predicting the branch at fetch time?

2. What is the benefit of having real history?

3. What is the benefit of having speculative history?

4. What implication does the pipe depth and Re-Order Buffer size have on the benefit of
speculative history?

## Question 3 (35%)
 Out Of Order architecture.

A) [5 points] The Out of Order architecture has the following stages: Fetch, Issue &
Rename, Execute, and Writeback. One of its strengths is that its ability to execute
instructions in a different order than the programmer originally specified.

However, the Fetch and Issue stages of Out of Order the architecture are always handled in
program order. Why?

B) [5 points] what is register renaming, why is it desirable, and how does it work?


-----

## Question 3 (Cont)

C) [5 points] Pipelined architectures have three different types of data hazards (data
dependencies) with respect to Registers. Name and define them. For each type, give a short
code sequence that illustrates the hazard and describe how an Out of Order architecture
handles these hazard.

D) [5 points] why does an Out of Order architecture need branch Prediction?


-----

## Question 3 (Cont)

E. [15 points] The following program sums the elements of an array:

for (i=0;i<n;i++)
sum += array[i];

<Op> <dst,src1,src2>
LD R3, sum
Loop: LD R2, array(R1)
Add R3,R3,R2
Add R1,R1,#1
CMP R1,#N / N is loop limit
JNE Loop
ST [R5],R3

And consider an out of order machine with the following stages:

F = Fetch Fetch 3 instructions per clock. Stalls when the decoder stalls.
D = Decode Decode 3 instructions per clock. Stalls when renamer stalls.
N = Rename Rename 3 instructions per clock. Stalls when there is no space in
the ROB for the renamed instructions.
S = Schedule Contains a ROB and RS that are practically infinite.
E = Execute Contains 9 general execution units, and only one port for memory.
Computed results can be consumed in the next cycle.
R = Retire Retires up to 3 instructions -inorder- from the ROB.

The branch predictor of this machine predicts always taken on the JNE command in the
code above.
The caches are Perfect - no cache misses.
Hint: there are enough execution units - they pose no limit, but only one load each cycle!

The following table contains the instruction flow inside this machine, you need to complete
this table. Assume N=3:

- fill the instruction flow, use the letters: F D N S E R,
Use â€œâ€“â€œ for stall, and X for a flush action.

- In case of branch misprediction, fill the instructions on the wrong path.

- For your help we added 2 columns after the instruction to help you track dependencies.
