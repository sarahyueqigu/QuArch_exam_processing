**Problem o: Warm-up (2 points).**

Do you think Facebook will start making their own phones?

**Problem 1 (12 points. Suggeste time: 10 mins)**

**Part a (3 points): Represent decimal value 66 in hexadecimal.**
## I 4-Y I

**Part b (3 points): Represent hexadecimal value oxu in binary**

###### I [ooc>/ I

**Part c (3 points): Octal is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits o to 7. Represent**
binary number 11110000 in octal.

###### 6,,
## I �

**Part d (3 points): Suppose we have two 16-bit 2's complement numbers:**

**0lXlX0XlXX000XXX**

**lO0XXXX00XXX0Xl0**

where some of the bits have not been identified, and they are represented by x.

Could the sum of these two numbers possibly result in an overflow? If yes, give an example. If
no, please explain.

**Problem 2 {14 points. Suggested time: 10 mins)**

**Part a (6 points): Express the two floating point numbers 2� and� in fnary normalized**

�

{3 points) 2 � in binary normalized form is:

###### l - [0 ]q \\ "/.. 2 \

(3 points)½ in binary normalized form is:

**Part b (4 points): As you know IEEE floating point standard has a 32-bit representation and a**
64-bit representation.
###### f v)
### &

{2 points) What is the bias used in the 32-bit representation? �; \ %f I j� ]

###### L?,)
## I I

(2 points) What is the minimum gap between two representable subnormal numbers in the
32-bit representation?
##### .)
## I

**Part c {4 points): In this problem, we assume that IEEE decided to add a new 10-bit**
representation, with its main characteristics consistent with the other two representations.

In this 10-bit representation, the value 33/256 is represented exactly

as <lg_1000�[0.9J. Your job: ]

decide the number of bits needed for the exponent and for the fraction. +' � _i;_
