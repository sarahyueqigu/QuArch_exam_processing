# Part A: Short Questions (25 points)

## Question A.1 (10 points)

For each of the following questions, answer True or False. Briefly justify your answer for credit.

1. After many years of research, branch prediction was finally proven to universally outperform

every known instance of multipath execution.

False, predicated execution is sometimes more effective. If the average cost of recovering from
misprediction ends up higher than that of executing both paths, the latter approach is preferable.

2. Both Tomasulo‚Äôs algorithm and scoreboarding enable correct out-of-order execution, but

Tomasulo‚Äôs algorithm is more effective in extracting ILP.

True, Tomasulo eliminates WAW and WAR hazards, unlike scoreboarding, thus improving the
ability of the processor to convert the available ILP to higher IPC.

3. Compiler code transformations can only be effective in improving performance if the

transformed code consists of fewer instructions compared to the original code.

False, Iron Law indicates that the number of instructions comprising the program is only one of
three factors affecting performance. Fewer slower instructions could overall hamper
performance.

4. IPC is a metric that can always be used to accurately evaluate the performance of parallel

programs executing on a multiprocessor system.

False, spinning on a lock results in high IPC, but does not correspond to higher performance.

5. ‚ÄúFlynn‚Äôs bottleneck‚Äù refers to the bottleneck imposed by the number of architectural

registers on the maximum ILP a processor can extract.


-----

False, Flynn‚Äôs bottleneck states that the number of instructions executed per cycle is capped by
the number of instructions fed into the pipeline per cycle.

## Question A.2 (9 points)

The Iron Law of processor performance states that program‚Äôs runtime is defined as the following
product: (Instructions/Program) x (Cycles/Instruction) x (Time/Cycle)

Assume we have a system with a scalar pipelined processor and we are considering a number of
modifications. For each of these modifications, mark how each of the three Iron Law terms is
affected. Your three options are: (i) **Likely increases, (ii) likely decreases, (iii) no effect. Briefly**
**justify your answers for credit.**

|Col1|Instructions/Program|Cycles/Instruction|Time/Cycle|
|---|---|---|---|
|Break each pipeline stage into two|No effect|Incr ‚Äì more cycles to traverse pipeline|Decr ‚Äì potentially shorter critical path|
|Add a huge BTB to cover all branches|No effect|Decr ‚Äì fewer stalls as branch target is more often known|Incr ‚Äì access latency may increase critical path|
|Use a compiler that performs extensive loop unrolling|Decr (slightly) Note: remember the # of instructions per program in the Iron Law refers to dynamic instruction count, not static.|Decr ‚Äì less branch prediction OR Incr ‚Äì instruction bloat hurts iCache locality|No effect|

## Question A.3 (6 points)

Assume an N-stage M-way superscalar in-order pipeline with N>10 and without any bypass paths.

(i) The decode stage, which checks for RAW dependencies, is at stage 4. How many
pairwise checks must be performed at each cycle to determine whether any of the
instructions at the decode stage must stall? Assume that the last stage‚Äôs writeback
happens in the first half of the cycle, as in lab 2.

"

2 ‚àóùëÄ[!] ‚àó(ùëÅ‚àí5) + 2 ‚àó+ ùëÄ‚àíùëñ

#$%

Checks with all pipes of stages ahead of the decode stage, plus checks within decode stage (two
operands of younger insn with one dest of older insn)

(ii) The pipeline features branch prediction support, and branch resolution occurs at
stage 6. In the event of branch misprediction, what is the **maximum number of**
instructions in the pipeline that may have to be flushed?

5*M + M-1 = 6M ‚Äì 1
M instructions from each of the preceding stages, plus up to M-1 instructions within the stage
where the resolution occurs.


-----

# Part B: 5-Stage Pipeline (20 points)

The following figure shows a scalar in-order 5-stage pipeline with partial bypassing ‚Äì note the
provided bypass paths: the only bypass path available is from the Memory to the Decode stage.

Assume that, unlike Lab 2, the same register in the register file cannot be both written and read
at the same cycle. Ignore all instructions that change control flow (Jumps and Branches) for all
**questions in Part B.**

## Question B.1 (4 points)
Give an example sequence of two or more instructions that will lead to a stall in this pipeline.
Clearly specify in your example

(i) what dependence causes the stall, and

(ii) for how many cycles.

A few different examples possible here ‚Äì simplest one is just two back-to-back ALU instructions
with RAW dependence, which would cause 1 cycle stall.


-----

## Question B.2 (6 points)
Write down the _complete logical expression that describes when the pipeline must stall as a_
function of the following terms (Note: you may not need to use all the terms):
IRD.op_type, IRE.op_type, IRM.op_type, IRW.op_type,
IRD.src1_needed, IRD.src1_reg, IRD.src2_needed, IRD.src2_reg,
IRE.dest_needed, IRE.dest_reg, IRM.dest_needed, IRM.dest_reg, IRW.dest_needed, IRW.dest_reg.
IRD, IRE, IRM, and IRW represent the instructions in the latches preceding the Decode, Execute,
Memory and Writeback stage, respectively.

### stall = 

IRE.dest_needed and [(IRD.src1_needed and IRD.src1_reg == IRE.dest_reg) or (IRD.src2_needed
**and IRD.src2_reg == IRE.dest_reg)]**
**or**
IRW.dest_needed and [IRD.src1_needed and (IRD.src1_reg == IRW.dest_reg and not X) or
(IRD.src2_needed and IRD.src2_reg == IRW.dest_reg and not Y)]

Where

**X = IRD.src1_needed and IRDE.src1_reg == IRM.dest_reg**
**Y = IRD.src2_needed and IRDE.src2_reg == IRM.dest_reg**

Note: Conditions X and Y are there to avoid unnecessary stalls if there‚Äôs a RAW both between ID
and Mem, and between ID and WB. The forward path from Mem can provide the latest value.

## Question B.3 (6 points)
An instruction has an i-dependency when, at the cycle it first attempts to advance through the
decode stage, it has a true dependence with an instruction currently residing i pipeline stages
ahead of it. Thus, an instruction may have a 1-dependency, 2-dependency, or 3-dependency if it
depends on the output of an instruction currently in the EX, MEM, or WB stage, respectively.

What is the CPI of Question B.1‚Äôs 5-stage pipeline under the following assumptions?

  - 10% of instructions only have a 1-dependency.

  - 25% of instructions only have a 2-dependency.

  - 20% of instructions only have a 3-dependency.

  - All aforementioned dependencies are between ALU operations.

Justify your answer to receive credit.

1-dependency and 3-dependency always stalls for one cycle
2-dependency never stalls


-----

CPI = 1 + 10% * 1 + 20% * 1 = 1.3

## Question B.4 (4 points)
Using the definition for i-dependency introduced in Question B.3, what is the CPI of Question
B.1‚Äôs 5-stage pipeline under the following assumptions?

  - 15% of instructions have both a 1-dependency and a 2-dependency.

  - 5% of instructions have both a 1-dependency and a 3-dependency.

  - All aforementioned dependencies are between ALU operations.

Justify your answer to receive credit.

CPI = 1 + 15% * 3 + 5% * 1 = 1.5

The tricky bit of this question is the 3-cycle cost for 15% of the instructions. You can‚Äôt forward a
value and store it until a following cycle. So when you can forward the 1-dependency from
Mem, you can‚Äôt forward the 2-dependency anymore, as the instruction is in WB, so the
forwarding path is not useful for instructions with both 1- and 2-dependency.


-----

# Part D: Out-of-Order Execution (30 points) 

## Question D.1 (6 points) 
Suppose you have an ISA that introduces a new MAX instruction with the following syntax and
semantics:

**MAX R1, R2, R3** **; R1 = max(R1, R2, R3)**

For the following instruction stream, identify all RAW (Read After Write), WAR (Write After Read)
and WAW (Write After Write) dependencies in the following table.

**If there are multiple dependencies, you must list them all.**

Do not worry about memory dependencies for this question. The dependencies between I4 and
older instructions have been filled for you.

I1: LW R0, 0(R1)

I2: LW R4, 42(R0)

I3: MAX R0, R2, R5

I4: ADD R0, R2, R0

I5: MAX R4, R3, R1

**Earlier (Older) Instruction**

I1 I2 I3 I4

I1

I2 RAW


**Current**


**Instruction**


I3 RAW, WAW WAR

I4 WAW WAR RAW, WAW

I5 -- RAW, WAW -- -
**Instruction Dependencies**

|I1|I2|I3|I4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||||||
|RAW|||||
|RAW, WAW|WAR||||
|WAW|WAR|RAW, WAW|||
|--|RAW, WAW|--|--||


The tricky bit here was to realize the format of the new instruction: it has three source
operands


-----

Next, we investigate the operation of an Out-of-Order Processor with an ROB. The processor
holds all data values in a physical register file (PRF), and uses a register alias table (RAT) to map
from architectural to physical register names. A free list is used to track which physical registers
are available for use. A reorder buffer (ROB) contains the bookkeeping information for managing
the out-of-order execution (but it does not contain any register data values).

The processor has the following pipeline stages

 - **Fetch: The next PC is fetched. The processor features a BHT in this stage, which is used to**

determine the next instruction that will be fetched whenever a branch instruction is
encountered.

 - **Decode: The instruction from the Fetch Buffer is decoded.**

 - **Issue: The instruction from the Decode Buffer is added into the ROB.**

 - **Execute: The instructions in the ROB which are ready to execute start executing.** Branch

Instructions that were mis-predicted update the next PC to be fetched this cycle.

 - **Writeback: Execute units writeback results on the CDB which updates the ROB and Physical**

Register File.

 - **Commit: Instructions are committed in-order from the ROB. The BHT is updated in this**

stage.

**The processor uses a 4-entry BHT with a simple 1-bit predictor, indexed by PC[3:2].**

**For Questions D-2, D-3 and D-5, you need to update the processor state (in all tables) after the**
**event described in that question has occurred.**

**The starting state in each question is the same, and the event specified in each question is the**
ONLY event that takes place for that question.
```
    0x1000 LW  R1, 0(R2)  
    0x1004 ADD R3, R2, R4  
    0x1008 ADD R1, R3, R3 
    0x100C BNEZ R4, skip
    0x1010 LW  R3, 0(R2) 
skip: 0x1014 SUB R1, R3, R2 
    0x1018 ADD R4, R3, R1
    0x101C ADDI R4, R4, 4

```

## Question D.2 (5 points) 
Fill out the new contents of
(i) ROB, (ii) PRF, (iii) Register Free List, (iv) RAT and (v) ROB head/tail pointers
**when the first ADD operation completes (before the LW operation that is ahead of it).**


-----

## Question D.3 (8 points) 
Fill out the new contents of
(i) ROB, (ii) PRF, (iii) Register Free List, (iv) RAT and (v) head/tail pointers
**when the next instruction issues.**

The next instruction is at skip, because the branch is taken!

## Question D.4 (2 points)
Assuming the state that you reached at the end of the previous question (D.3), how many
new instructions can be issued before any older instruction commits? Why?

Only one, because there‚Äôs only one physical register left in the free list.


-----

## Question D.5 (6 points)
Fill out the new contents of
(i) ROB, (ii) PRF, (iii) Register Free List, (iv) RAT and (v) head/tail pointers
**when the first instruction in the ROB throws an exception.**

## Question D.6 (3 points)
Assume the processor also had hardware support for RAT snapshots, and a snapshot was taken
at the time the LW instruction (at PC 0x1000). Considering Question D.5‚Äôs scenario, what is the
benefit of having a RAT snapshot corresponding to an instruction raising an exception?

Recovery is faster with a RAT snapshot. Instead of sequentially walking back the register
renamings in the ROB to retrieve the correct RAT state, the RAT can be instantly restored from
the snapshot.

# Part C: Branch Prediction (25 points)

**Assume a processor equipped with an 8-entry Branch History Table (BHT) with 2-bit counters,**
indexed using PC[4:2]. The BHT is initially in the following state:

### 000 11

 001 00

 010 01

 011 01

 100 11

 101 00

 110 01

 111 10

**Figure C-1: BHT**

Consider the following code snippet:

**label** **PC** **Instruction** **note**

start: 0x101C ADDI R1, R1, -1

0x1020 AND R2, R1, 1 //Bitwise AND operation

0x1024 BNEZ R2, target1 //Branch to PC target1 if R2 ¬π 0

0x1028 ADD R0, R0, R1

0x102C J target1 //Jump to PC target1

‚Ä¶

target1: 0x2A74 AND R3, R1, 3 //Bitwise AND operation

0x2A78 XOR R2, R3, 2 //Bitwise XOR operation

0x2A7C BEQZ R2, loop //Branch to PC loop if R2 == 0

0x2A80 SUB R3, R3, R1

loop: 0x2A84 BNEZ R1, start //Branch to PC start if R1 ¬π 0

Assume initial register values R0=0, R1=100.


-----

## Question C.1 (9 points)
Fill out a row of the following table for each of the first nine branch instructions executed in the
program.

**Branch** **BHT** **Prediction** **Actual** **Updated BHT** **Correct prediction?**

**instruction** **index** **(T/NT)** **branch** **entry** **(Y/N)**

**PC** **direction**

0x1024 001 NT T 01 N

0x2A7C 111 T NT 01 N

0x2A84 001 NT T 10 N

0x1024 001 T NT 01 N

0x2A7C 111 ŒùŒ§ T 10 N

0x2A84 001 NT T 10 N

0x1024 001 T T 11 Y

0x2A7C 111 T NT 01 N

0x2A84 001 Œ§ T 11 Y

100 = 64 + 32 + 4 √† bottom-most bits three bits we care about for branch 0x2A7C are 00
First four iterations:
11 XOR 10 = 01 √† NT
10 XOR 10 = 00 √† T
01 XOR 10 = 11 √† NT
00 XOR 10 = 10 √† NT

Branches at PC 0x1024 and 0x2A84 alias into the same BHT entry

## Question C.2 (4 points)
What is the total branch misprediction ratio when this program runs to completion? Justify your
answer for credit.

|Branch instruction PC|BHT index|Prediction (T/NT)|Actual branch direction|Updated BHT entry|Correct prediction? (Y/N)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0x1024|001|NT|T|01|N|
|0x2A7C|111|T|NT|01|N|
|0x2A84|001|NT|T|10|N|
|0x1024|001|T|NT|01|N|
|0x2A7C|111|ŒùŒ§|T|10|N|
|0x2A84|001|NT|T|10|N|
|0x1024|001|T|T|11|Y|
|0x2A7C|111|T|NT|01|N|
|0x2A84|001|Œ§|T|11|Y|


-----

### Total branches mispredicted
 Total branch instructions executed [=        ][81]100 ‚àó3

Justification:
0x1024 interleaves between T, NT. 1[st] time mispredict 2/2, next times 1/2 √† 51 mispreds
0x2A84 is always T (99 times), NT the last time. Mispredicts first two times and very last time √†
3 mispreds
0x2A74 is NT, T, NT, NT (repeats). 1[st] time mispredict 3/4, every next time 1/4 √† 27 mispreds

## Question C.3 (3 points)
The prediction accuracy of the branch at PC 0x1024 using the BHT alone turns out to be low. How
would you enhance the branch predictor to improve that branch‚Äôs prediction accuracy? Describe
your enhanced mechanism and briefly **explain why it would perform better than Figure C-1‚Äôs**
baseline 2-bit BHT.

Correct answers would mention leveraging history/temporal correlation. GHR or LHR would work
well to get close to 100% prediction accuracy.

## Question C.4 (9 points)
The following figure shows a hypothetical 9-stage pipeline. The pipeline also features a BTB and
a BHT at different stages. Your goal is to deduce at which stage the BHT and BTB reside, as well
as deduce the stages where the branch direction and target are known.

**Figure C-2: 9-Stage Pipeline with Branch Prediction**


-----

The following table reports the number of pipeline bubbles incurred depending on the accuracy
of branch direction and target prediction.

**(BHT)**

**Actually**

**BTB Hit?** **Predicted** **Pipeline bubbles**

**Taken?**

**Taken?**

Y Y Y 1

Y Y N 6

N Y Y 3

N N N 0

Based on the above information, answer the following questions:

1. Select the correct answer. The pipeline‚Äôs fetch stage (A)

a. Always speculatively fetches PC+4.
b. Stalls until it is confirmed that the fetched instruction is not control-altering.

2. The branch target address is determined at stage _D_ because _when the BTB is missed,

there is a 3-cycle penalty__.

3. The BHT is updated at stage _G_ because _that‚Äôs when the branch direction is resolved,

since the penalty of mispredicting the branch direction is 6 cycles_.

4. The BHT is used for branch direction prediction at stage _B_ because __the penalty for

correct branch direction prediction of taken branch is 1 cycle_.

5. The BTB is used for branch target prediction at stage _B_ because ___(same reason as

above)______________.

Note: answering A/B or B/A for questions 4/5 would also be correct (in addition to B/B), as it‚Äôs

possible to know only one of two pieces of information (direction or target) early on but not be

able to convert this knowledge to a correct next PC fetch before stage B.

|BTB Hit?|(BHT) Predicted Taken?|Actually Taken?|Pipeline bubbles|
|---|---|---|---|
|Y|Y|Y|1|
|Y|Y|N|6|
|N|Y|Y|3|
|N|N|N|0|
