###### Problem M7.1: Branch Prediction

This problem will investigate the effects of adding global history bits to a standard branch
prediction mechanism. In **this** **problem** **assume** **that** **the** **MIPS** **ISA** **has** **no** **delay** **slots.**

Throughout this problem we will be working with the following program.
```
loop:
   LW R4, 0(R3)
   ADDI R3, R3, 4
   SUBI R1, R1, 1
b1:
   BEQZ R4, b2
   ADDI R2, R2, 1
b2:
   BNEZ R1, loop

```
Assume the initial value of R1 is n (n>0).
Assume the initial value of R2 is 0 (R2 holds the result of the program).
Assume the initial value of R3 is p (a pointer to the beginning of an array of 32-bit integers).

All branch prediction schemes in this problem will be based on those covered in the lecture. We
will be using a 2-bit predictor state machine, as shown below.

In state 1X we will guess not taken. In state 0X we will guess taken.

Assume that b1 and b2 do not conflict in the BHT.

**Problem** **M7.1.A** **Program**

What does the program compute? That is, what does R2 contain when we exit the loop?

**Problem** **M7.1.B** **2-bit** **branch** **prediction**

Now we will investigate how well our standard 2-bit branch predictor performs. Assume the
inputs to the program are n=8 and p[0] = 1, p[1] = 0, p[2] = 1, p[3] = 0,â€¦ etc. That is the array
elements exhibit an alternating pattern of 1's and 0's. Fill out Table M7.1-1 (note that the first
few lines are filled out for you). What is the number of mispredicts?

Table M7.1-1 contains an entry for every branch (either b1 or b2) that is executed. The Branch
Predictor (BP) bits in the table are the bits from the BHT. For each branch, check the

corresponding BP bits (indicated by the bold entries in the examples) to make a prediction, then
update the BP bits in the following entry (indicated by the italic entries in the examples).

**Problem** **M7.1.C** **Branch** **prediction** **with** **one** **global** **history** **bit**

Now we add a global history bit to the branch predictor, as described in the lecture. Fill out Table
M7.1-2, and again give the total number of mispredicts you get when running the program with
the same inputs.


**Problem** **M7.1.D**

Now we add a second global history bit.
mispredicts you get for the same input.

**Problem** **M7.1.E**


**Branch** **prediction** **with** **two** **global** **history** **bits**

Fill out Table M7.1-3. Again, compute the number of

**Analysis**


Compare your results from problems M7.1.B, M7.1.C and M7.1.D. When do most of the
mispredicts occur in each case (at the beginning, periodically, at the end, etc.)? What does this
tell you about global history bits in general? For a large n, what prediction scheme will work best?
Explain briefly.

**Problem** **M7.1.F** **Analysis** **II**

The input we worked with in this problem is quite regular. How would you expect things to
change if the inputs were random (each array element were equally probable to be 0 or 1). Of the
three branch predictors we looked at in this problem, which one will perform best for this type of
input? Is your answer the same for large and small n?

What does this tell you about additional history bits: when are they useful and when do they hurt
you?

###### Problem M7.2: Branch Prediction

Consider a CPU with a pipeline pictured on
the right. The first stage of the pipeline
fetches the instruction. The second **stage of**
the pipeline recognizes branch instructions
and **performs** **branch** **prediction using a**
BHT. If the branch is predicted to be taken,
it forwards the decoded target of the branch
to the first stage, and kills the instruction in
the first stage. The **fifth** **stage of the**
pipeline reads the registers and resolves **the**
**correct** **target** **of** **the** **branch. If the branch target was mispredicted, the correct target is**
forwarded to the first stage, and all instructions in between are killed. The remaining stages finish
the computation of the instruction.

The processor uses a **single** **global**
**history** **bit to remember whether the last**
branch was taken or not. There is only **one**
**line** **in** **the** **BHT, so the address of the**
branch instruction is not used for selecting
the proper table entry. Each entry in the
table is labeled as TW for Take Wrong,
TR for Take Right, NTW for do Not Take
Wrong and NTR for do Not Take Right,
as pictured below. The setup of the BHT
predictor is illustrated on the right.


-----

10/6/2021

In this question we will study execution of the following loop. This processor has **no branch**
delay slots. You should assume that branch at address 1 is never taken, and that the branch at
address 5 is always taken.

Instruction Address Instruction

6 NOP

You should also disregard **any** **possible** **structural** **hazards. The processor always runs at full**
speed, and there are no **pipeline** **bubbles (except for those created by the branches).**

**Problem** **M7.2.A**

Now we study how well the history bit works, when it is being updated **by** **the** **fifth** **stage of the**
processor. The fifth stage also updates the BHT based on the result of a branch. The same BHT
entry that was used to make the original prediction is updated.

Please fill in the table below.

You should fetch a new instruction every cycle. You should fill in the Branch _Prediction and the_
_Prediction_ _Correct? columns for branch instructions only (note that the branch prediction_
actually happens one cycle **after the instruction is fetched). You should fill in the** _Branch_
_Predictor_ _State columns whenever they are updated. Please circle_ **the** **instructions** **which** **will**
**be** **committed.**

The first three committing instructions fetched have been filled in for you. You should enter
enough instructions to add **8** **more** **committing** **instructions. You may not need all the rows in**
the table.

**Problem** **M7.2.B**

Now we study how well the branch history **bit works, when it is** **being** **updated** **speculatively**
by the second stage of the processor. If the branch is mispredicted, the fifth stage sets the branch
history bit to the correct value. Finally, the fifth stage also updates the BHT based on the result
of a branch. The same BHT entry that was used to make the original prediction is updated.

Please fill in the table below. The notation in the table should be same as in M7.2.A.

The first three committing instructions fetched have been filled in for you. You should enter
enough instructions to add **8** **more** **committing** **instructions. You may not need all the rows in**

###### Problem M7.3: Branch Prediction

Consider the fetch pipeline of UltraSparc-III processor. In this part, we evaluate the impact of
branch prediction on the processorâ€™s performance. There are no branch delay slots.

Here is a table to clarify when the direction and the target of a branch/jump is known.

|Instruction|Taken known? (At the end of)|Target known? (At the end of)|
|---|---|---|
|BEQZ/BNEZ|R|B|
|J|B (always taken)|B|
|JR|B (always taken)|R|


-----

10/6/2021

**Problem M7.3.A**

As a first step, we add a branch history table (BHT) in the fetch pipeline as shown on the next
page. In the B stage (Branch Address Calc/Begin Decode), a conditional branch instruction
(BEQZ/BNEZ) looks up the BHT, but an unconditional jump does not. If a branch is predicted to
be taken, some of the instructions are flushed and the PC is redirected to the calculated branch
target address. The instruction at PC+4 is fetched by default unless PC is redirected by an older
instruction.

For each of the following cases, write down the number of pipeline bubbles caused by a branch
or jump. If there is no bubble, you can simply put 0. (Y = yes, N= no)

###### Predicted Actually

**Problem M7.3.B**

To improve the branch performance further, we decide to add a branch target buffer (BTB) as
well. Here is a description for the operation of the BTB.

1. The BTB holds entry_PC, target_PC pairs for jumps and branches predicted to be taken.

Assume that the target_PC predicted by the BTB is always correct for this question. (Yet
the direction still might be wrong.)

2. The BTB is looked up every cycle. If there is a match with the current PC, PC is

redirected to the target_PC predicted by the BTB (unless PC is redirected by an older
instruction); if not, it is set to PC+4.

Fill out the following table of the number of pipeline bubbles (only for conditional branches).

|Conditional Branches|BTB Hit?|(BHT) Predicted Taken?|Actually Taken?|Pipeline bubbles|
|---|---|---|---|---|

Given a snapshot of the BTB and the BHT states on entry to the loop, fill in the timing diagram
for one iteration (plus two instructions) on the next page. (Donâ€™t worry about the stages beyond
the E stage.) We assume the following for this question.

1. The initial values of R5 and R1 are zero, so BR1 is always taken.
2. We disregard any possible structural hazards. There are no pipeline bubbles (except for

those created by branches.)

3. We fetch only one instruction per cycle.
4. We use a two-bit predictor whose state diagram is shown below. In state 1X we will guess

not taken; in state 0X we will guess taken. `BR1 and BR2 do not conflict in the BHT.`

###### Problem M7.4: Complex Pipelining (Spring 2014 Quiz 2, Part B)

You are designing a processor with the complex pipeline illustrated above. For this
problem assume there are no unconditional jumps or jump registerâ€”only conditional
branches.

Suppose the following:

  - Each stage takes a single cycle.

  - Branch addresses are known after stage Branch Address Calc/Begin Decode.

  - Branch conditions (taken/not taken) are known after Register File Read.

  - Initially, the processor always speculates that the next instruction is at PC+4,

without any specialized branch prediction hardware.

  - Branches always go through the pipeline without any stalls or queuing delays.


-----

10/6/2021

**Problem M7.4.A**

How much work is lost (in cycles) on a branch misprediction in this pipeline?

**Problem M7.4.B**

If one quarter of instructions are branches, and half of these are taken, then how much
should we expect branches to increase the processorâ€™s CPI (cycles per instruction)?

**Problem M7.4.C**

You are unsatisfied with this performance and want to reduce the work lost on branches.
Given your hardware budget, you can add only one of the following:

  - A branch predictor to your pipeline that resolves after Instruction Fetch Stage 1.

  - Or a branch target buffer (BTB) that resolves after Instruction Fetch Stage 2.

If each make the same predictions, which do you prefer? In one or two sentences, why?


-----

10/6/2021

**Problem M7.4.D**

You decide to add the BTB (not the branch predictor). Your BTB is a fully tagged
structure, so if it predicts an address other than PC+4 then it always predicts the branch
address of a conditional branch (but not the condition!) correctly. For partial credit,
**show your work.**

If the BTB correctly predicts a next PC other than PC+4, what is the effect on the
pipeline?

If the BTB predicts the next PC incorrectly, what is the effect on the pipeline?

Assume the BTB predicts PC+4 90% of the time. When the BTB predicts PC+4 it is
accurate 90% of the time. Otherwise it is accurate 80% of the time. How much should we
expect branches to increase the CPI of the BTB design? (Donâ€™t bother trying to compute
_exact decimal values.)_

###### Problem M7.5: Branch Prediction (Spring 2015 Quiz 2, Part A)

Ben Bitdiddle is designing a processor with the complex pipeline illustrated below:

The processor has the following characteristics:

  - Issues at most one instruction per cycle.

  - Branch addresses are known at the end of the B stage (Branch Address Calc/Begin Decode).

  - Branch conditions (taken/not taken) are known at the end of the R stage (Register File Read).

  - Branches always go through the pipeline without any stalls or queuing delays.

Benâ€™s target program is shown below:
```
for(int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) ANDi R1 0
{ LOOP:MODi R2 R1 2
  if(i % 2 == 0) //Branch B1 BNE R2 M4 // B1
  { //Not taken (Do something A)
    (Do something A) â€¦ â€¦
  }
                     M4: MODi R3 R1 4
  if(i % 4 == 0) //Branch B2
                        BNE R3 END // B2
  { //Not taken
                            (Do something B)
    (Do something B)
                        â€¦ â€¦ 

```
Suppose the following: }
```
                     END: SUBi R4 R1 1000000
} //Branch LP
                        BNE R4 LOOP // LP
                        â€¦ â€¦

```
The MODi (modulo-immediate) instruction is defined as follows:
```
MODi Rd Rs imm: Rd <- Rs Mod imm

In steady state, what is the probability for each branch in the code to be taken/not taken on average?

**Problem M7.5.B**

In steady state, how many cycles per iteration are lost on average if the processor always speculates that
every branch is not taken (i.e., next PC is PC+4)?

**Problem M7.5.C**

Ben designs a **static branch predictor to improve performance. This predictor always predicts** **not**
**taken for forward jumps and taken for backward jumps. The prediction is available at the end of the**
**B stage. In steady state, how many cycles per iteration are lost on average?**

**Problem M7.5.D**


To improve performance further, Ben designs a dynamic branch predictor with local branch history
**registers and 1-bit counters.**

Each local branch history registers store the last several outcomes of a single branch (branches B1, B2
and LP in our case). By convention, the most recent branch outcome is the least significant bit, and so
on. The predictor uses the local history of the branch to index a table of 1-bit counters. It predicts not
taken if the corresponding 1-bit counter is 0, and taken if it is 1. Assume local branch history registers
are always correct.

How many bits per branch history register do we need to perform perfect prediction in steady state?

**Problem M7.5.E**

The local-history predictor itself is a speculative structure. That is, for subsequent predictions to be
accurate, the predictor has to be updated speculatively.

Explain what guess the local history update function should use.

**Problem M7.5.F**

Ben wants to design the data management policy (i.e., how to manage the speculative data in different
structures of the predictor) for the local-history branch predictor to work well. Use a couple of
sentences to answer the following questions.

1) What data management policies should be applied to each structure?

2) For your selected data management policies, is there any challenge for the recovery mechanism

when there is misspeculation? If so, what are the challenges?
