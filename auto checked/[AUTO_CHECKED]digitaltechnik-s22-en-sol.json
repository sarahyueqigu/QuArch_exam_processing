This engine has the following characteristics:\n\n\u02c6 The engine has four main pipeline stages: Fetch (F), Decode (D), Execute (E), and Write-back (W).\n\n\u02c6 The engine can fetch one instruction per cycle, decode one instruction per cycle, and write back the result of one instruction per cycle.\n\n\u02c6 The engine has two execution units: 1) an adder to execute ADD instructions and 2) a multiplier to execute MUL instructions.\n\n\u02c6 The execution units are fully pipelined. The adder has two stages (E1-E2), and the multiplier has four stages (E1-E2-E3-E4). Execution of each stage takes one cycle.\n\n\u02c6 The adder has a two-entry reservation station, and the multiplier has a three-entry reservation station.\n\n\u02c6 An instruction always allocates the first available entry of the reservation station (in top-to-bottom order) of the corresponding execution unit.\n\n\u02c6 Full data forwarding is available, i.e., during the last cycle of the E stage, the tags and data are broadcast to the reservation station and the Register Alias Table (RAT). For example, an ADD instruction updates the reservation station entries of the dependent instructions in the E2 stage. So, the updated value can be read from the reservation station entry in the next cycle. Therefore, a dependent instruction can potentially begin its execution in the next cycle (after E2).\n\n\u02c6 The multiplier and adder have separate output data buses, which allow both the adder and the multiplier to update the reservation station and the RAT in the same cycle.\n\n\u02c6 An instruction continues to occupy a reservation station slot until it finishes the Write-back (W) stage. The reservation station entry is deallocated after the Write-back (W) stage.\n",
