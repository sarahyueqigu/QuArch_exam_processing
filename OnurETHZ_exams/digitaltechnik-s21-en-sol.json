          "solution": "Explanation.\n\n1 : odata must be declared as an output signal since values are assigned to it in the second always block. It cannot be an input signal since inputs are read-only signals and no assignments are allowed to them. odata must be also declared as reg since the assignments are made inside an always block.\n\n2 : nval must be declared as reg[31:0] since values are assigned to it inside the first always block.\n3 : default is a correct choice since all other cases for a 2-bit values (i.e., 2'b00, 2'b01, and 2'b10) are defined in the case statement. The other choices are not correct since they do not properly specify the value of 3. For example, in 2'b3, the problem is that 3 is not a valid binary digit but 2'b must be followed by a 2-bit binary value.\n\n4 : Choices with assign are not valid since the assign keyword cannot be used in an always block. Choice C does not specify an assignment operator but an equality comparison, hence it is not a valid choice either. The correct choice is D, which assigns 0 to odata using non-blocking assignment operator.\n\n5 : The correct choice is D due to the same reasons as in 4 .",
