Still they are used.\n\n• Using N bits it is possible to represent 2N different numbers when a sign/magnitude number system is used.\n\nSolution: False, 0 is represented twice.\n\n• While there are methods to represent both positive and negative integers, it is not possible to represent fractions or real numbers using binary numbers.\n\nSolution: False, fixed and floating point number systems can be used to represent such numbers.",
