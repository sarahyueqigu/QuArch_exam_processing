The state machine should have one input and one output. This FSM's goal is to detect a stable transition in the input signal from repeated logic-0 to repeated logic-1. The output should be logic-1 only when the input sequence of \"0-0-1-1\" is observed. The output should be zero in all other cases.",
        "solution": "We need to keep track of the bit values in the last four bits. This requires 16 states. However, many of these states behave the same. We can reduce the number of states down to five. Since this is a Moore machine, the output should be independent from the input. Therefore, there should be a state for the posedge where the output is \"1\". All other states will have the output of \"0\". The FSM goes to the posedge state only when the last four bits are 0-0-1-1. We call this state S0011. The FSM should reach to the posedge state from another state where the last three input bits are 0-0-1. We call this state SX001. The FSM should reach to the 0-0-1 state from a state where the last two input bits are 0-0. Note that it does not matter what the input bits are, earlier than the last two zeros. We call this state SXX01. The FSM should not stay in state S0011 for more than one clock cycle as when the new input comes, the last four bits will not be 0-0-1-1 anymore. If the input is 1, the next state should be SXXX1: the last bit is zero but it is not a posedge and the earlier bits are not important. If the input is 0, the next state should be SXX10: the last two bits are 1-0 and the earlier bits are not important. Intuitively, if the state is SXXX1, the FSM should remain at this state if the input is 1 and go to SXX10 if the input is 0. If the state is SXX10, the FSM should not remain at this state regardless of the input. If the input is 0, the next state is SXX00. If the input is 1, the next state is SXXX1.

After the first iteration of the loop, the instruction is fetched for the second time at the clock cycle 12. The instruction JNZ L1 stalls at the Decode stage and delays MUL R4, R1, R1. Due to this delay, there are 10 cycles in between the Nth and (N+1)th times the instruction is fetched, after the first iteration of the loop. If R1 = 1024, this instruction is fetched and executed 8 times so far. Since in cycle T the first instruction in the loop (MUL R4, R1, R1) is being fetched, no cycles of the 9th iteration have executed so far. Then, T = 12 + 7\u00d7 10 = 82",
