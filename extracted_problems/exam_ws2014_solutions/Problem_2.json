The following are the problems:\n\n• (A+ C) is redundant if the X there was chosen as '1'\n\n• (A+B +D) is redundant.\n\n• (A+B + C) is redundant, but (A+B + C) is missing\n\n• (A+ C +D) is plain wrong. It covers 1 and X. Should not be there\n\nThe X values have not been optimally used, this results in a more complex equation, there are more 0s than 1s, so a SOP form would probably be better, in addition there are redundant terms, the equation is not simplified",
