  "problem_context": "Your current version of ZippyCAD runs through a benchmark design in 43 minutes on your ZIPS10 computer. ZIPS has a new model that they are offering to sell to you. ZIPS30 is a scalar machine like ZIPS10, but 3 times faster. Or you can get the ZIPS1010 vector upgrade that performs vectorized code at 10 times the performance of ZIPS10. You know that ZippyCAD spends a lot of time in its numerical library, so you are intrigued.",
