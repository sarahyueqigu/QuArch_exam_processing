You are in a meeting to discuss what can be done to improve the performance of this processor. Your colleagues have made the following suggestions. For each suggestion, first state whether or not the idea will work, and then briefly explain why.",

If the cycle time is the same than a processor that uses 5 CPI is 5 times slower than a processor that uses 1 CPI. A multi-cycle processor can only be faster if the reduction in the clock cycle time is more than the increase in the average CPI. In general this is not possible. Multi-cycle processors are mostly used to share expensive resources (memories, adders).",

However, there are not many problems that have a fully parallelized solution where two proecssors can work independently.
