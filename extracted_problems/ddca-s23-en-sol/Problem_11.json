  "problem_context": "You are given a systolic array of 2× 2 Processing Elements (PEs), interconnected as shown in Figure 2. The inputs of the systolic array are labeled as H0, H1 and V0, V1. Figure 3 shows the PE logic, which performs a multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation and saves the result to an internal register (reg). Figure 3 also shows how each PE propagates its inputs. We make the following assumptions:\n\nˆ The latency of each MAC operation is one cycle, i.e., if the inputs to a PE are available in cycle c, the updated register value will be available in cycle c+ 1.\n\nˆ The propagation of the values from i0 to o0, and from i1 to o1, takes one cycle.\n\nˆ The initial values of all internal registers is zero.",

Recall that the multiplication of two K × K matrices is de�ned as follows:\n\nCij = ∑(k=0 to K-1) Aik ×Bkj\n\nAs an example, for K = 2, the calculation for C00 is as follows:\n\nC00 = A00 ×B00 +A01 ×B10\n\nCompute the multiplication in the minimum possible number of cycles. Fill the following table with:\n\n1. Each input element (from matrices A2×2 and B2×2) in the correct cycle and input port of the systolic array (H0, H1 and V0, V1).\n\n2.
