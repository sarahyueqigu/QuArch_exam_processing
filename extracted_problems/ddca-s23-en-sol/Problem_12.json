  "problem_context": "An ETH student writes two programs (A and B) and runs them on two di\ufffderent toy machines (M1 and M2) to determine the type of the prefetcher used in each of these machines. She observes programs A and B to generate the following memory access patterns (note that these are cacheblock addresses, not byte addresses).\n\nProgram A: 27 memory accesses\n\na, a + 1, a + 2, a + 3, a + 4, a + 8, a + 16, a + 32, a + 64,\na, a + 1, a + 2, a + 3, a + 4, a + 8, a + 16, a + 32, a + 64,\na, a + 1, a + 2, a + 3, a + 4, a + 8, a + 16, a + 32, a + 64\n\nProgram B: 501 memory accesses\n\nb, b + 2, b + 4, ...., b + 998, b + 1000\n\nThe student measures the coverage (i.e., the fraction of program's memory accesses correctly predicted by the prefetcher) and accuracy (i.e., the fraction of sent prefetch requests that are used by the program) of the prefetching mechanism in each of the machines. The following table shows her measurement results:\n\nMachine M1 Machine M2\nCoverage Accuracy Coverage Accuracy\nProgram A 6/27 6/27 1/3 9/26\nProgram B 499/501 499/501 499/501 499/500\n\nThe student knows the following information about the machines:\n\n\u02c6 There are three possible choices for the prefetching mechanism:\n\n1. Stride prefetcher\n\n2. 1st-next-block prefetcher with degree 1: Prefetches cacheline A+1 after seeing access to block A\n\n3. 4th-next-block prefetcher with degree 1: Prefetches cacheline A+4 after seeing access to block A\n\n\u02c6 Each prefetcher has large enough resources to detect and store access patterns.\n\n\u02c6 Each prefetcher starts with an empty table.\n\n\u02c6 Each prefetcher sends only one prefetch request for each program access.\n\n\u02c6 Each memory access is separated long enough in time so that all prefetch requests sent can complete before the next access occurs.\n\n\u02c6 No prefetcher employs any con\ufffddence mechanism (e.g., the stride prefetcher will send a prefetch request to address A+4 by only seeing two consecutive memory accesses to addresses A and A+2).",
