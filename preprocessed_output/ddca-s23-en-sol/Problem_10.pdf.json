Starting with an empty cache, an application accesses three cache blocks with the following addresses in the order given below:\n\n0 \u2192 2 \u2192 4\n\nA malicious programmer tries to reverse-engineer the number of sets and ways in the L1 data cache by issuing only two more accesses and observing the cache hit rate across these two accesses. Assume that the programmer can insert the malicious accesses only after the above three accesses of the application.",

There may be multiple solutions; please give the lowest possible addresses that can enable the identification of the number of sets and ways. Please explain every step in detail to get full points.",

Each configuration shows a drawing of the cache state after the three initial accesses. Rows and columns represent sets and ways, respectively, and the LRU address is shown for each occupied set:\n\n(a) (4 sets, 1 way)\n\n4\n-\n2\n-\n\n(b) (2 sets, 2 ways)\n4 2\n- -\n\n(c) (1 set, 4 ways)\n0 2 4 -\n\nAt this point, all three configurations have a 100% miss rate since they started cold. In order to differentiate between the three configurations with just two more accesses, we need to induce different hit/miss counts in each of them. The only way this is possible is if one configuration experiences two hits, another two misses, and the last one hit and one miss. Only two solutions exist to produce this case:\n\n\u02c6 [0 \u2192 2]\n\n(a) 0 miss, 2 hit = 50% miss rate\n(b) 0 miss, 2 miss = 100% miss rate\n(c) 0 hit, 2 hit = 0% miss rate\n\n\u02c6 [0 \u2192 4]\n\n(a) 0 miss, 4 miss = 100% miss rate\n(b) 0 miss, 4 hit = 50% miss rate\n(c) 0 hit, 4 hit = 0% miss rate\n\nChoosing the lowest possible addresses, the correct solution is 0 \u2192 2",
