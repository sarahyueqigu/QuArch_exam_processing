If both manuals might be useful, you would prefer the ISA manual since it is much cheaper than the microarchitecture manual.\n\nFor each of the following questions that you would like to answer, decide which manual is more likely to help. Note: we will subtract 1 point for each incorrect answer and award 0 points for unanswered questions (the minimum number of total points you can get for this question is 0).",
