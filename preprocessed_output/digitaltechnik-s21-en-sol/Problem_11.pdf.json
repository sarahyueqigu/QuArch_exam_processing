    "problem_context": "A runahead execution processor is designed with an unintended hardware bug: every other instruction in runahead mode is dropped by the processor after the fetch stage. Recall that the runahead mode is the speculative processing mode where the processor executes instructions solely to generate prefetch requests. All other behavior of the runahead mode is exactly as we described in lectures. When a program is executed, which of the following scenarios could happen compared to a runahead processor without the hardware bug and why? Circle YES if there is a possibility to observe the described behavior and explain in the box (either if you answer YES or NO). Assume that the program has no bug in it and executes correctly on the processor without the hardware bug.",
