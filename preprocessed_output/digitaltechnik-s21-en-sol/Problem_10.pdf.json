    "problem_context": "You are trying to reverse-engineer the characteristics of a cache in a system, so that you can design a more efficient, machine-specific implementation of an algorithm you are working on. To do so, you have come up with three sequences of memory accesses to various bytes in the system in an attempt to determine the following four cache characteristics: Cache block size (8, 16, 32, 64, or 128B). Cache associativity (2-, 4-, or 8-way). Cache replacement policy (LRU or FIFO). Cache size (4 or 8KiB). The only statistic that you can collect on this system is cache hit rate after performing each sequence of memory accesses. Here is what you observe: Sequence Addresses Accessed (Oldest \u2192 Youngest) Hit Rate: 1. 0 16 24 25 1024 255 1100 305 2/8, 2. 31 65536 65537 131072 262144 8 305 1060 3/8, 3. 262145 65536 4 2/3. Assume that the cache is initially empty at the beginning of the first sequence, but not at the beginning of the second and third sequence. The sequences are executed back-to-back, i.e., no other accesses take place in between sequences. Thus, at the beginning of the second sequence, the contents are the same as at the end of the first sequence. At the beginning of the third sequence, the contents are the same as at the end of the second sequence.",

Depending on the cache block size, we can group addresses that belong to the same cache block as follows: 8B: {0}, {16}, {24,25}, {255}, {305}, {1024}, {1100}. \u2234 Number of possible hits = 1. 16B: {0}, {16,24,25}, {255}, {305}, {1024}, {1100}. \u2234 Number of possible hits = 2. 32B: {0,16,24,25}, {255}, {305}, {1024}, {1100}. \u2234 Number of possible hits = 3. 64B: {0,16,24,25}, {255,305}, {1024}, {1100}. \u2234 Number of possible hits = 4. 128B: {0,16,24,25}, {255,305}, {1024,1100}. \u2234 Number of possible hits = 5.

Thus, there are 4 offset bits. The access to address 31 in sequence 2 would hit because the cache block would not be replaced. The access to address 305 in sequence 2 would hit because the cache block would not be replaced. The access to address 65537 in sequence 2 would hit because the cache block would not be replaced. Therefore, all the other accesses should miss. The access to address 65536, 131072 and 262144 in sequence 2 would miss because addresses 65536, 131072 and 262144 do not belong to any cache block previously accessed. Addresses 65536, 131072 and 262144 would be placed in set 0 if the cache associativity is 2-way, 4-way, or 8-way, independently of the cache size. Address 8 must be a miss, so its cache block must be replaced by cache blocks that map to set 0 (addresses 65536, 131072 and 262144). For this to happen, the associativity must be 2-way. Therefore, the cache is 2-way associative.",
