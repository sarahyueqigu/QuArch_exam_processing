    "problem_context": "We define the switch node in Figure 3 to have 2 inputs (I, Ctrl) and 1 output (O). The Ctrl input always enters perpendicularly to the switch node. If the Ctrl input has a True token (i.e., a token with a value of 1), the O wire propagates the value on the I wire. Else, the 2 input tokens (I, Ctrl) are consumed, and no token is generated at the output (O). We define the inverter node in Figure 4 to have 1 input (I) and 1 output (O). The node negates the input token (i.e., O = !I). We define the TF node in Figure 5 to have 3 inputs (IF, IT, Ctrl) and 1 output (O). When Ctrl is set to True, O takes IT. When Ctrl is set to False, O takes IF. The \u2265 node outputs True only when the left input is greater than or equal to the right input. The +1 node outputs the input plus one. The + node outputs the sum of the two inputs. A node generates an output token when tokens exist at every input, and all input tokens are consumed. Where a single wire splits into multiple wires, the token travelling on the wire is replicated to all wires. The X and Y inputs automatically produce tokens as soon as the previous token on the wire is consumed. The order of these tokens follows the pattern (note, the following are all single digit values spaced appropriately for the reader to easily notice the pattern): X: 0 01 011 0111 01111 Y: 1 22 333 4444 55555",
