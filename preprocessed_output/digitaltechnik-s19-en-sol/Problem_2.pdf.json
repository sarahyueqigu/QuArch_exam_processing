Each D Flip-Flop works with an asynchronous active-low reset signal.\n\nExplanation:\n\n\u2022 D and Q signals are two-bit-wide. Therefore, this code implements two D flip-flops.\n\u2022 The reset input is included in the sensitivity list, therefore it is not synchronous.\n\u2022 The code resets the output if the reset signal is low. Thus, the reset signal is active-low.",
