Note that there is an adder and a multiplier in this machine. The processor is supplied with a seven instruction program following reset. The state below was captured at some point in time during the execution of these seven instructions. Anything marked with a \u2013 is unknown and can\u2019t be relied upon for your answer. You should assume that the bottommost instruction in the reservation station arrived earliest and the topmost instruction in the reservation station arrived last.\n\nID V Tag Val V Tag Val\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nE 0 C - 0 A -\n\nF 0 A - 1 - 20\n\nC 0 A - 0 A -\n\nID V Tag Val V Tag Val\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nD 0 B - 0 E -\n\nB 1 - 20 0 F -\n\nA 1 - 20 1 - 30\n\nSRC 1                      SRC 2  SRC 1                      SRC 2\n\nReg V Tag Val\n\nR0 1 - 5\n\nR1 0 A 10\n\nR2 0 B 20\n\nR3 1 - 30\n\nR4 0 C 40\n\nR5 0 D 50\n\nR6 1 - 60\n\nR7 1 - 70\n\nRAT",
